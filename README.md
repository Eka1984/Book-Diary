# Book Diary
The Reading Diary app is a full-stack mobile application developed independently as part of my exploration into mobile development with Flutter. This app is designed for book enthusiasts who wish to keep a digital diary of their reading journey. It allows users to track books they're interested in reading, as well as those they have already read, and provides a personalized space for notes and reflections on each book.

Personalized Notes: Attach notes or reflections to each book entry, enriching your reading experience.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface designed for seamless navigation and interaction.
